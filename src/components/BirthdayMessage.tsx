                Twenty years ago, you came into this world and made it infinitely more beautiful. From the moment you arrived, you've been nothing but pure joy, love, and light in our family. Watching you grow into the amazing woman you are today has been one of life's greatest privileges.

                You are not just pretty on the outside â€“ though you absolutely are stunning â€“ but your inner beauty shines even brighter. Your kindness, your laughter, your caring heart, and your incredible spirit make you truly one of a kind. You have this magical way of making everyone around you feel special and loved.
              </p>

              <p>
                As your brother, I couldn't be more proud of who you've become. You're intelligent, compassionate, strong, and absolutely adorable in every way. You face life with such grace and determination, and I admire you more than you'll ever know.
